# Nexus Launcher
A minecraft launcher build using Tauri + VueJs + Ts

## [WIP] This project is a work in progress! I am the only one working on this. If you want to join me feel free to contact me on discord `eatingtheham`.

## My idea
Yes, there are now many different minecraft launchers to chose from. But each one has their own disadvantages.

**Launcher**|**Disadvantage**
:-----:|:-----:
Curseforge|1. Clunky
| |2. No Modrinth Support
| |3. Closed Source
| |4. Ads
Modrinth App|1. No Curseforge support
GdLauncher|1. Slow development
| |2. Closed source
| |3. Ads
MultiMC + Forks|1. Old UI

So I thought I would make my own one for eduactional purposes and because not one launcher is the best. 
I would like to see if I can make this launcher fully community supported instead of just a few devs working on it. This will have multiple benefits.
1. Faster development.
2. Better colaboration with the community to make something that works for them

Therefore, readability and documentation of the code is important.
Of course I will still have to accept pull requests to make sure that random people can't add their own code on their own

### Current design

The floating sidebar
- Honestly felt like making something that stood out amoung the rest of the launchers. But also I wanted the launcher to be simplistic and easy to use. Having a sidebar with a few simple buttons would work.

### Some other features i would like to implement
- Mod Loader installation
- Multiple instance mod installation.
- Modpack installation from any modpack type
- Client side server hosting
- Custom user theming
